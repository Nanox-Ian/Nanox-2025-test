                <p class="section-text">
                    TI cares about the security of your Personal Data, and we use a variety of administrative and 
                    technical measures to help protect it, including commercially available security technologies 
                    such as secure servers, firewalls, and encryption. It is your responsibility to safeguard any password, 
                    user ID, and other Personal Data while using our sites. Regardless of protective efforts, transmissions 
                    over the Internet are never guaranteed to be entirely secure or error-free.

                    TI may retain information, including your Personal Data, for the length of time necessary to 
                    fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, consistent with this Privacy Policy, 
                    unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. Please note that even if TI deletes 
                    your Personal Data, it may persist on backup or archival media for an additional period of time.
